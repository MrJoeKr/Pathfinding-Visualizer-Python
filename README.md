# Path-visualizer-in-python
Application which visualizes various pathfinding algorithms. Made in Python with the use of module [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

# Setup
- Start **``run.pyw``** file to run the program.
- In the main menu, choose algorithm and heuristic (if heurestic is used)
- Click **``Go To Board``** to start experimenting

# Requirements:
  - Python 3.x
  - modules:
    - [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

# How to visualize algorithm
Click on the **tick-box** in the bottom-right corner to have algorithm visualized.
    
# Controls
  - **LEFT MOUSE CLICK** for drawing start / end / wall node
  - **RIGHT MOUSE CLICK** for deleting start / end / wall node
  - **SPACE** to start the path finding
  - **"R"** to clear board
  - **BACKSPACE** to go to menu
  - **ESCAPE** to exit program

    
### Enjoy.
